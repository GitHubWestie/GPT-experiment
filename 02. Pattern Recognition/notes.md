# Pattern Recognition

### Task: Find patterns in sequences and create a rule.

📝 Activity:

1. Look at these number sequences and try to guess the pattern:

- 2, 4, 6, 8, __ ?
- 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, __ ?
- 100, 50, 25, __ ?

2. Write a rule for each pattern:
"The next number is ______ because ______."

📌 Takeaway: Identifying patterns helps predict outcomes and optimize solutions.

### Solution

1. 2, 4, 6, 8, __ ?
- The next number is 10 because the sequence increments by 2 each time.

2. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, __ ?
- The next number is 13 because each number is added to the number before it to get the next number in the sequence.

3. 100, 50, 25, __ ?
- The next number is 12.5 because each number in the sequence is half the number before it.
